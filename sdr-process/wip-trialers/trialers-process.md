#### How to find your Trialers in HubSpot

Use the HubSpot filters linked in the "In Hubspot" page below to find the top free and/or trial accounts based on factors such as the number of users in a trial, company size, and trial activity:

{% content-ref url="../../playbook/segmentation/in-hubspot.md" %}
[in-hubspot.md](../../playbook/segmentation/in-hubspot.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also use [this list](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/8443689/objects/2-1138478/views/6957836/list) to see all of the GitBook Organizations that belong to you.&#x20;

#### How to see what they are building

Look at the `Use Case` property (filled out by the contact when they created the trial):

You can also look at the actual documentation that they are building in SN10 - the link is on the GitBook Organization HubSpot page in the left sidebar under "Links". You can also get to it from the individual contacts' pages:

#### What you should be looking out for

Research the company and see if they look like they might fit the Qualification criteria, and if they look like our Ideal Customer Profile:

{% content-ref url="../sdr-less-than-greater-than-ae/qualified-opportunities.md" %}
[qualified-opportunities.md](../sdr-less-than-greater-than-ae/qualified-opportunities.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../playbook/ideal-customer-profile.md" %}
[ideal-customer-profile.md](../../playbook/ideal-customer-profile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Top things to look out for:

* **Over 50 employees**
* **Use Case = Internal Knowledge Base** - because they will need more internal users in their GitBook
* **Company recently got funding/ is growing** - they could grow into more seats
