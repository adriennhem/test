# ðŸ¤· How to Qualify Prospects

âœ… `SDRs can qualify prospects by email communication, by calling them on the phone, or by scheduling a 15-minute zoom call with them.`

{% hint style="success" %}
**Goal**: to qualify the opportunity and remove as much friction as possible. We do not want to add steps to the sales process/sales experience just to say we qualified a prospect. If we can qualify them and pass them to an AE without speaking to them, that's fine as well.
{% endhint %}

## Some qualification questions for SDRs to ask:

* What is your use case? What type of documentation are you trying to build/create or migrate?
* Is your documentation going to be fully public, private or both?
* Is there any use case for sharing documents externally and securely? (visitor authentication)
* How many users will you have using GitBook internally? Reader, Editor and Admin access. (not external readers).
* What are you using or have in place currently?
* Are you looking at any other documentation solutions?
* Will you be needing SAML SSO?

## SDR Discovery Call Playbook

Use the [SDR Discovery Call Playbook](https://app.hubspot.com/playbooks/8443689/compose/570933) on HubSpot to take notes during your discovery call.  It prompts you with questions to ask and provides quick answers so you don't have to type everything out.&#x20;

If you pass the lead to an AE, tell them to look at your notes in the playbook. Using the playbook means we can standardise the format of the SDR <> AE handover.&#x20;
