# August 21

## Achieved VS. Goals

We thought that August would be dry for Sales as the number of sales forms and requests were lower than July but we have managed to exceed the target.&#x20;

lWe have achieved 172% of the target ($5,600 MRR) with 100% of the time elapsed. This represents a total MRR of $9,646 MRR.

Shoutouts to Alex and Mark for their professionalism. They have made sure to reach their individual targets before going on paid time off. d

Although we have achieved the target, I am not satisfied with the way we have achieved it. We have only closed 3 deals that are worth $400+ MRR for a total amount of $1,220 MRR. The vast majority of the deals closed were worth between $100 and $300 MRR (total $5,900 MRR). It's actually challenging to spend more time with deals that are worth more than $400 MRR because the reps have to handle 45 deals each per month. Moving forward, the solution would be to hire a Salesperson dedicated to work on small deals (less than $300 MRR)   R0  n
