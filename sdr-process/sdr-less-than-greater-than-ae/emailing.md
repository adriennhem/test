* ****[**Preparing to email**:](emailing.md#research) You need to do research to understand your customer
* **Selecting valuable insights**: Offer your customer something of value to them
* ****[**Writing an email**:](emailing.md#writing-an-email) Write high quality, personalised emails
* **Using video in your email**: Stand out and save time with a short video
* **Measuring engagement**: Learn what works, so you can do more of what does work and stop doing what doesn't work

### Research

Google, LinkedIn, Crunchbase. Use links from your research in your email



### **Writing an email**

Provide value and structure your email using the RRR structure:

* **Relevance** - demostrate research of the person or company, and references something similar
* **Reward** - offer value such as a link to insights, relevant blog post, video etc
* **Request** - call to action&#x20;

#### Best Practices

* <mark style="color:blue;">**DO**</mark>: Keep it short, get to the point
* <mark style="color:blue;">**DO**</mark>: capture interest with the subject line and first 50 characters
* <mark style="color:blue;">**DO**</mark>: talk about "how customer X and Y experienced benefit A and great benefit B" rather than talking about "great feature a, b and c". Show how we can help them and what they can do with it.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**DO**</mark>: use the person's first name in front of your request to draw their attention
* <mark style="color:red;">**DO NOT**</mark>: start the opening sentence with "I..." it should be about them, not you
* <mark style="color:red;">**DO NOT**</mark>: include attachments, always link to content

{% hint style="info" %}
Try using a "P.S." after you sign off in an email. Use it to draw attention to something valuable specifically about them. Something unusual but relevant
