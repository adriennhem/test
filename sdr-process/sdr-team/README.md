**Documentation is extra important in a remote-first company**. Think of this documentation as a living thing, like a beautiful bonsai tree. It's never finished, it's always growing. Feel free to edit it, make additions, and suggest changes.&#x20;

We should all feel empowered to own our documentation and work to improve it.

`Welcome to the team üí™`

### Do these things to be awesome üëç

`Small things make a difference.`&#x20;

:smile: **Set a profile picture in all of the apps that we use**. That means Slack, GitBook, Gmail, Zoom, Linear etc. This helps other people know who they are working with, and it's extra important in a remote first company like GitBook.



üìÜ **Change your Calendly URL** to something that makes sense, like sophie-gitbook. It looks way better than sophie-1231523. Also make the URLs for the meeting types nice and sensible:

`https://calendly.com/sophie-gitbook/15min` looks much nicer than `https://calendly.com/sophie-1231523/general-15-minute-meeting-clone`
