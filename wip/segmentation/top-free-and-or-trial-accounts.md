## Sales Strategy

**Land high value logos from self-service signups. **Pick out the best logos by using Clearbit from the self-service funnel to engage with. Given relationships are typically not established at this stage, this is often a segment ripe with unclaimed, sales-ready opportunities.

## Sales Tactics

* Surface sales-ready accounts based on raw end-user activity within GitBook. Start by surfacing 1-2 high intent signals.
* Identify the champions and buyers in target accounts and cross reference roles within the account before engaging.
* Send helpful content, like Loom videos or documentation, when you see that certain features havenâ€™t been used, or used properly.
