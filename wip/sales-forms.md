# Sales Forms

## Location

Users can contact sales via the navbar on the marketing website located at: [https://gitbook.com](https://gitbook.com). There are two types of forms: **contact us** and **request demo. **

{% hint style="info" %}
We display a Calendly widget once they have completed the request demo form. So that they can directly book a meeting.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Process

1. Adrien to check the #notif-hubspot-channel and assign the contact to the AE.&#x20;
2. There is no need for the AE to create a new deal as everything is created automatically.&#x20;
3. You can find the message on the form on the left sidebar under the category message.&#x20;
