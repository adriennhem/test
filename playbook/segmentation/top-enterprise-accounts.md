## Sales Strategies

**Sell additional capabilities.** Sell **** Visitor Authentication. This can be done to the same teams already using the product or across teams.

**Upsell usage.**  Identify opportunities for additional use cases.

**Increase seat penetration.** Reps can leverage penetration metrics (e.g., how many seats are used out of the total number of people within an org/company) to identify poorly penetrated accounts and help increase seat count. This works particularly well for seat-based pricing, as you might imagine.

## **Sales Tactics**

* Look for low usage of certain enterprise features and make sure that customers are fully ramped and getting value.
* Make sure you are building relationships with the various product champions in your customersâ€™ organization by looking at the most active users that are also inviting other users to GitBook.
