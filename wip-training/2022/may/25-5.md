## Key takeaways

_Here we note down what we've learned based on our training and use as a guide to go back to and look at things we've discussed. Repetition and practice is the way to get better._

_We come up often against Confluence and Notion. How do we differ from these? Why are our customers leaving those tools?_

_Sharepoint and Google doc's as well. Why change from these? ROI from using GB as opposed to a free/cheaper tool like these._&#x20;
