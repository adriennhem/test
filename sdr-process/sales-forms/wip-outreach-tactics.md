**Step 1 - LinkedIn Visit**&#x20;

Visit the lead's LinkedIn Profile

**Step 2 - Call Them**&#x20;

Make sure the calls are at least 5 minutes apart (1-2 minutes often indicated an emergency from a partner, family member, etc)

**Step 3 - Leave a Voicemail (if not answered)**

Leave a voicemail and refer to the email which you'll follow up with. Example voicemail:

{% hint style="info" %}
Hello Mary,&#x20;

This is Sophie from GitBook.&#x20;

I'm responding to your enquiry for more information.

Mary, I will send you an email, but in case you prefer to reach out via phone, my number is xxx-xxx-xxxx.

Again, this is Sophie from GitBook, and my phone number is xxx-xxx-xxxx.

Looking forward to hearing from you Mary!
{% endhint %}

**Step 4 - Email them**

Follow the voicemail immediately with an email, and refer to the voicemail

{% hint style="info" %}
