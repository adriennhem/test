# Invoicing

{% hint style="info" %}
Invoicing is only available for customers that spend more than $500/month. The invoice must be for an annual payment (We do not raise invoices for customers on monthly plans).&#x20;

Please contact Adrien if you are unsure about the process.&#x20;

## Sales Ops

If the customer has paid the invoice but the payment has not been associated with the account then the payments need to be captured.&#x20;

To do so you need to visit: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments?status%5B%5D=uncaptured](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments?status%5B%5D=uncaptured)
