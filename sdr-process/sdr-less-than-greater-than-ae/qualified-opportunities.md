# Qualified Opportunities ✅

{% hint style="success" %}
A **qualified opportunity** is a potential Enterprise deal _or_ deal that can grow into an Enterprise account.
{% endhint %}

## Qualified Opportunity Criteria

When doing research on prospects, emailing them, speaking to them on a call, etc. SDRs try to qualify prospects by finding the below criteria:

1. **50+ employees** (Find this by researching the company on LinkedIn)
2. A **compelling/critical event** such as:
   * Starting to build documentation from scratch to build better processes
   * Consolidating all their different information into one place (example: "We have things in Google Docs, Powerpoint, other documentation tools or places, etc. and we want to have it all in one place)
   * Migrating over to another documentation tool that is no longer working for them (such as Confluence, Notion, etc.)
   * or any other strong reason to need a documentation tool like GitBook&#x20;
3. They need to be **building documentation** such as:
   * Private docs: Internal Knowledge Base, Internal Wikis, Design System, etc.
   * Public docs: API, Product, FAQ docs (but must have more than 15 internal users that need reader/editor access NOT external readers)
   * Semi-private docs: needs to securely share documentation privately to external users
   * Any combination of 2 or all of the above
   * Tip: You can check SN10 or Amplitude to see what type of documentation they are building or check on their website if they have existing documentation there already. If not, ask them. It's a great way to start a conversation!
4. Bonus point but not necessary: **High Product Usage** (if they are using GitBook heavily, building lots of docs)

{% hint style="success" %}
SDRs need to have 1, 2 and 3 criteria in order to consider a prospect qualified and pass to an AE.
{% endhint %}

###

### Instantly qualified! Pass directly to an AE if:

* Number of internal users needed is above 15
* Need any enterprise features, SAML SSO or Visitor Authentication (even if they say they only need 5+ users or they're smaller <50 people company)
* If they ask for Enterprise pricing or Invoicing.

(If you're not sure, ask an AE if you should pass it or do a call with the prospect as an SDR to make sure)



### **Some examples of typically qualified customers include:**

* Need to create an internal knowledge base
* Sharing documents securely (visitor authentication)
* Want to consolidate and migrate over all their documentation in one place
* Starting to build out documentation now
* They use a competitor like Notion and it doesn’t work for them because they need something for technical teams/technical documentation.
* They use Confluence, ReadMe, Archbee, Document360, Docusaurus or other direct competitors.

## What happens to unqualified prospects?

**Unqualified prospect**: Prospects that are not potential Enterprise deals but are potential Team/Business plans that have potential to grow.

If they do not meet 1, 2 and 3 criteria, then close them and nurture them until they are ready to grow into an Enterprise account.

Find out if they will have the need to expand by asking them about their use cases and understanding their needs. Find out when they might have that need so you can drive further adoption of the product for different use cases in the company.
