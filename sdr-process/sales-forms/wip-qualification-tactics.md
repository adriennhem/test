#### SDR Discovery Call Playbook - HubSpot

Use the [SDR Discovery Call Playbook](https://app.hubspot.com/playbooks/8443689/compose/570933) on HubSpot to take notes during your discovery call.  It prompts you with questions to ask and provides quick answers so you don't have to type everything out.&#x20;

If you pass the lead to an AE, tell them to look at your notes in the playbook. Using the playbook means we can standardise the format of the SDR <> AE handover.&#x20;

**How to use:**

On the contact page of the lead you are calling, scroll down to "Playbooks" in the right column, and choose "SDR Discovery Call":
