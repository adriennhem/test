# Qualifying prospects

_SDRs can qualify prospects by email communication or by scheduling a 15-minute call with them._

{% hint style="success" %}
**Goal**: to qualify the opportunity and remove as much friction as possible. We do not want to add steps to the sales process/sales experience just to say we qualified a prospect. If we can qualify them and pass them to an AE without speaking to them, that's fine as well.
{% endhint %}
