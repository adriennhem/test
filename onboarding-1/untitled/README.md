# Start, Stop, Continues

## How to run a session

1. Create a Miro board using the naming `onboarding - [name of teamate] - start stop continue`.&#x20;
2. Set up a calendar invite with an agenda and invite everyone involved in the onboarding process. It does not matter if they have only been partially involved. They might have some inputs they want to share.&#x20;
   * Agenda Example:&#x20;
     * Outcome: refine the onboarding process for AEs Before the meeting: - Please fill in the miro board prior to the meeting with the appropriate stickers (it's ok if you have nothing to share). \[link to miro board] - We will review and discuss the cards during the meeting.
3. Run the session live and stick to the allocated time (45 min seems to be enough time).&#x20;

## After the session

Write up the key findings under the right sub-page and above the last session.&#x20;
