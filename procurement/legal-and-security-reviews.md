# Legal & security reviews

For a deal to justify a legal and security review, the MRR must be at least 1000 and there should be good growth potential.

### Legal review

When you receive a request for redlines or a MSA/DPA review, please ping the slack channel #procurement-reviews with the details of the deal and what needs to be reviewed and by when. Dave and/or Cristina can then provide guidance on if & when it can be completed.

### Security reviews

When we receive a security review, it's on the rep speaking with the prospect to take a first pass at filling it out. We have a Master Security Questionnaire bank of reviews with all questions we've answered in the past (separated by review completed, but easily searchable with keywords), this should help you get most of the way since there's so much repetition in the reviews.

As you fill out the review, please create a new tab in the master questionnaire and add in the questions you answer in your review (unless it's an exact duplicate of an existing question in the master bank).

When you've finished your pass and you have outstanding questions that you can't answer, organise the tab so the questions that need help are clustered. You can then tag an engineer for support answering the final questions.
