# 25/5

Every week we will take time to train as a team. The best athletes play together, and train together and keep looking for ways to improve. Growth is part of our culture as an AE team. Good AEs get better over time, great AEs consistently look for ways to improve.Trainings will look different from time to time depending on the needs of the team during that time. You can suggest training ideas.

**Things to do:**

* Add your **topic suggestions**.
* Add calls to review based on **topic suggestions**.
* Write down and summarise **key takeaways**.
