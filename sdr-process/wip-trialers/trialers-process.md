#### How to find your Trialers in HubSpot

Use the HubSpot filters to find the top free and/or trial accounts:

{% content-ref url="../../playbook/segmentation/in-hubspot.md" %}
[in-hubspot.md](../../playbook/segmentation/in-hubspot.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also use [this list](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/8443689/objects/2-1138478/views/6957836/list) to see all of the GitBook Organizations that belong to you.&#x20;

#### How to see what they are building

Look at the `Use Case` property (filled out by the contact when they created the trial):

You can also look at the actual documentation that they are building in SN10 - the link is on the GitBook Organization HubSpot page in the left sidebar under "Links". You can also get to it from the individual contacts' pages:
