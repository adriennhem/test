  At GitBook, customers sign up for a Team or Business plan on their own with a
  credit card. Self-serve revenue is fantastic, but there are likely
  opportunities to convert customers to larger plans.

## Sales Strategies

**Convert Team and Business accounts to Enterprise. **Identify accounts in the Team and Business tier that have high conversion potential from a product usage perspective and reach out the buyers and champions in those accounts to drive a sales conversation.

**\[FOR LATER] Rollup workspaces to a single account. **Organization, can have multiple workspaces, apps, accounts, or whatever those are called within GitBook. Creating a comprehensive view of all usage within a prospective organization provides an opportunity to engage IT buyers in order to upsell compliance and security capabilities, resulting in a larger ACV.

## Sales Tactics

* Focus on customer love, or trial user NPS because it makes it so much easier to have a conversation with a potential buyer about WHY a company is seeing bottom-up adoption.
* Send potential buyers and champions data on how their team is already using your product, as well as information on features that are only available in an enterprise (or other more expensive) plan.
* Be more aggressive in experimenting with offers to your existing customer base.
