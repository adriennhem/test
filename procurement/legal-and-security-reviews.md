# Legal & security reviews

For a deal to justify a legal and security review, the MRR must be at least 1500.

### Legal review

When you receive a request for redlines or a MSA/DPA review, please ping the slack channel #procurement-reviews with the details of the deal and what needs to be reviewed and by when. Dave and/or Cristina can then provide guidance on if & when it can be completed.

### Security reviews
