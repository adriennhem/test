## Positioning&#x20;

Readme targets the upmarket/enterprise segment with the set of features and the pricing that they offer. They want to build a developer hub to build and customize API documentations. They are trying to capture anyone that has a public documentation requirement with their self-service offering.&#x20;

## Typical use cases for Readme

* **API documentation**: very strong value proposition around this use case. See the [features list](https://readme.com/pricing).
* **Technical documentation**: poor value as most features would start at $2K/project/month. Twice as expensive as GitBook for simple use cases.&#x20;

## Trap-setting Questions
