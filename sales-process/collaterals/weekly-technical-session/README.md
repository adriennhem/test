# Weekly Technical Session

## Why?&#x20;

GitBook is not very technical as a product but the audience that we address is. Therefore we need to gain a better understanding of the workflow of our users, as well as the jargon that they use. This does not mean that you are supposed to be an engineer/product/design person but rather that you should have a basic understanding of their thinking process.&#x20;

## How?&#x20;

We are running weekly technical sessions that are compulsory. The sessions should not exceed 30 min. The sessions are short by design because they should address one specific topic.&#x20;

## Outcome

We should know if the session has been a success or not. We use a rating system to close the loop. Before the session, everyone should put how they feel about the topic. Rating should be done after the sessions too.&#x20;

You can find the outcome [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FiCx2x0lJu2bIZUW04V7SCmY0g8pKBmipRDF7CZLgkE/edit#gid=0).&#x20;
