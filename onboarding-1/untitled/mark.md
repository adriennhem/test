### Key findings

* We have all the information in GitBook but I don't know how to find them:
  * In previous companies, there was a cheat sheet with all you need to know to be successful in your role.
  * More about putting people in the position of being able to educate themselves.
  * Cheatsheet saying this is where you can find all information you need to know for X.
  * Cheatsheet of what you should do if youâ€™re not busy.
* Shadow another Account Executive.&#x20;
* Have a "buddy" that is not your manager.&#x20;
* Product playbook:
  * The product is fairly complicated to know about the product. The product playbook is about setting boundaries between what is good enough to know about our product.
* Tag and record the calls with customers to enable newcomers to watch them online.
* Stop having an onboarding doc too complicated:
  * &#x20;Training shared with Mark was too narrow and too detailed => set the boundaries about what is needed during week1 and what will take more time.
  * Useful to still have onboarding documentation to be able to know what to expect and what the role entails.
  * Way simpler doc.
* Deep dive session and introduction to product from product, engineering and sales/CS team.
* Show and tell: GitBook demo in front of the team for the newcomer
* Role-specific onboarding scorecard:
  * What is required to be fully onboarded?
  * &#x20;In front of each section write down new comers own rating + new rating (after 1st iteration) + go-to-person/manager rating.
  * Add comments about what is missing you to go to 10.
