# SDR > AE Handoff

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use the HubSpot Round Robin to select an AE

On the contact's page, change the **Lead Status** to `Open Deal`. After about a minute, an AE will be assigned to the **AE Owner** property. You will have to refresh the page to see this.



### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set up Zoom meeting / Send Calendly&#x20;

You can either create the meeting directly in google calendar or use the AE's Calendly link (see links below) to schedule it. Using the Calendly is easier because you can pick the Prospect's timezone and see when the AE is available in their timezone.&#x20;

Remember to fill in the Calendly scheduling with your Prospect's name and email address - not yours. There is space for a note - put something like `"Booked in by Sophie"`, so the AE knows that this meeting was booked in via you.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Open the AE's Calendly link in an incognito browser, otherwise Calendly will check against YOUR google calendar and only show times when YOU are free.
{% endhint %}
