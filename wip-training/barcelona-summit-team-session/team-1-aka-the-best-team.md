Currently, the Engineering team is on GitBook. Not much action yet in GitBook. They are hiring a new Director/Manager of Engineering, who will be starting at the beginning of June.&#x20;

Organize training for the engineering team.&#x20;

Look at their website for open jobs. Get alerts when these people are hired.&#x20;

Have trainings/in-product prompts to enable users to create documentation.&#x20;

Ask decision-makers for referrals (internal and external).&#x20;



Map the account. Identify decision makers

Find out why head of eng and other users have guest permissions in Sn10. Educate Karl about this and get them to re-assign their permissions to editor or reader. The [Head of Eng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-tatham-22753811/?originalSubdomain=es) has no access so unlikely to see value of GitBook.&#x20;
