# Qualifying prospects

_SDRs can qualify prospects by email communication or by scheduling a 15-minute call with them._

{% hint style="success" %}
**Goal**: to qualify the opportunity and remove as much friction as possible. We do not want to add steps to the sales process/sales experience just to say we qualified a prospect. If we can qualify them and pass them to an AE without speaking to them, that's fine as well.
{% endhint %}

### Some qualification question ideas for SDRs to ask:

* What is your use case? What type of documentation are you trying to build/create or migrate?
* Is your documentation going to be fully public, private or both?
* Is there any use case for sharing documents externally and securely? (visitor authentication)
* How many users will you have using GitBook internally? Reader, Editor and Admin access. (not external readers).
* What are you using or have in place currently?
* Are you looking at any other documentation solutions?
* Will you be needing SAML SSO?
