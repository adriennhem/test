# SDR Team 😎

`Welcome to the team 💪`

In this section you will find everything you need to know about how the SDR team at GitBook works.&#x20;





### Do these things to be awesome 👍

`Small things make a difference.`&#x20;

:smile: **Set a profile picture in all of the apps that we use**. That means Slack, GitBook, Gmail, Zoom, Linear etc. This helps other people know who they are working with, and it's extra important in a remote first company like GitBook.



📆 **Change your Calendly URL** to something that makes sense, like sophie-gitbook. It looks way better than sophie-1231523. Also make the URLs for the meeting types nice and sensible:

`https://calendly.com/sophie-gitbook/15min` looks much nicer than `https://calendly.com/sophie-1231523/general-15-minute-meeting-clone`
