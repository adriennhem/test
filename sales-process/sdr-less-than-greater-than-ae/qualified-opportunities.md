# Qualified opportunities

{% hint style="success" %}
_Potential Enterprise deals or deals that can grow into an Enterprise account._
{% endhint %}

### Hard qualification criteria

* 50+ employees (Find this by researching the company on LinkedIn)
* They have a **compelling/critical event**. (Do they have existing docs on their website? Are they building documentation that you can see from SN10 or Amplitude? Have they mentioned a reason they are evaluating GitBook to you?)
* Bonus point but not necessary: High Product Usage (if they are using GitBook heavily, building lots of docs)

#### _Some examples include_

* Need to create an internal knowledge base
* Sharing documents securely (visitor authentication)
* Want to consolidate and migrate over all their documentation in one place
* Starting to build out documentation now
* They use a competitor like Notion and it doesnâ€™t work for them cause they need something for technical teams/technical documentation.
* They use Confluence, ReadMe, Archbee, Document360, Docusaurus or other direct competitors.

#### Pass directly to an AE if:

* Number of needed users is above 15
* Need any enterprise features, SAML SSO or Visitor Authentication (even if they say they only need 5+ users or they're smaller <50 people company)
* If they ask for Enterprise pricing or Invoicing.

(If you're not sure, ask an AE if you should pass it or do a call with the prospect as an SDR to make sure)
