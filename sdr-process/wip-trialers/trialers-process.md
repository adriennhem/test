### How to find your Trialers in HubSpot

Use the HubSpot filters linked in the "In Hubspot" page below to find the top free and/or trial accounts based on factors such as the number of users in a trial, company size, and trial activity:

{% content-ref url="../../playbook/segmentation/in-hubspot.md" %}
[in-hubspot.md](../../playbook/segmentation/in-hubspot.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can also use [this list](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/8443689/objects/2-1138478/views/6957836/list) to see all of the GitBook Organizations that belong to you.&#x20;



### What makes a Trialer a good lead?

Research the company and see if they look like they might fit the Qualification criteria, and if they look like our Ideal Customer Profile:

{% content-ref url="../sdr-less-than-greater-than-ae/qualified-opportunities.md" %}
[qualified-opportunities.md](../sdr-less-than-greater-than-ae/qualified-opportunities.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../playbook/ideal-customer-profile.md" %}
[ideal-customer-profile.md](../../playbook/ideal-customer-profile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Top things to look out for:

* **Over 50 employees**
* **Use Case = Internal Knowledge Base** - because they will need more internal users in their GitBook [(how to see)](trialers-process.md#how-to-see-what-they-are-building)
* **Company recently got funding/ is growing** - they could grow into more seats
* **They have high product usage** [(how to see)](trialers-process.md#who-are-the-top-users-on-the-trial)

#### How to see what they are building

Look at the `Use Case` property (filled out by the contact when they created the trial):

![In the list view](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-02 at 1.43.07 PM.png>)

You can also look at the actual documentation that they are building in SN10 - the link is on the GitBook Organization HubSpot page in the left sidebar under "Links". You can also get to it from the individual contacts' pages:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-02-02 at 1.49.20 PM.png>)



#### Who are the top users on the trial?

You can see who the top users of a trial are by checking out the `Product Score` property on each contact's page. You can also see any features that they've activated (or tried to activate) under the `Feature Exposure - Last 30d` property on their contact page.

* add screenshots/video to this part, and how you can see all contacts on one trial by filtering

#### Reaching out to Trialers - HubSpot sequences

You might want to add Trialers to sequences to deliver a series of tailored messages during their trial. We have a number of different sequences based on priority and use case already in HubSpot. For inspiration, take a look at:

* [Trialers - Medium Qualified - IKB](https://app.hubspot.com/sequences/8443689/sequence/62059818?page=1\&q=trial)
* [Trial Sign-up Sequence - KnowledgeBase (B)](https://app.hubspot.com/sequences/8443689/sequence/61928475?page=1\&q=trial)
* [Trialers - Medium Qualified - Design Systems](https://app.hubspot.com/sequences/8443689/sequence/62470038?page=1\&q=trial)
* [Trialers - Medium Qualified - Open Source](https://app.hubspot.com/sequences/8443689/sequence/62355020?page=1\&q=trial)
* [Trialers - Medium Qualified - Product Docs](https://app.hubspot.com/sequences/8443689/sequence/62354972?page=1\&q=trial)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to use any of these sequences, make a clone of the sequence (including the email templates) and update with your details (name, calendly link etc).
