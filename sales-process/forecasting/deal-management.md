# Deal Management

### **Deal Stages**

_Add your deal to the right stage of the Sales Pipeline. Each stage has an associated close rate percentage (%) to it._

_Examples:_

* **`Proof of concept`**: when you are demoing to the company, they are trialing the product and you are still trying to prove the value of GitBook to them.
* **`At risk`**: when you do not think it will close, but there is a small chance it will.
* **`Price negotiation`**: when GitBook is the right fit, you have sent pricing over and are negotiating.
* **`Procurement`**: when they have sent the order form to procurement.

### **Amount**

_This is the amount you most likely think they will close for. NOT the amount you hope or have quoted them. This is your best guess estimate of how much MRR this deal will be worth._

### **Close date**

_Add the month that this deal has the highest chance of closing. ****_&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**Important: Add the close date you most likely believe this deal will close NOT when you hope they will close.**
{% endhint %}

We work with the last day of the month so: January 31, February 28, and so on.

Example: if you have a deal that has a 40% chance of closing this month or 60% chance of closing next month. Add the next month as the close date.

### **SOFU: (Sense of F Urgency)**

_Add the sense of urgency that this deal has._ \
__\
__It's always better to go with their urgency vs. ours. __ For example: if they need something in place asap, an existing provider's contract is expiring , or something they've mentioned that has a time constraint, then use that to add urgency. \
If there is no urgency, then add an incentive for them to close by when you believe is realistic.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Important note: do not offer them an incentive to close for a certain month if they have not told you that they can close by then.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Find out what incentivises them to close. For example: it might be a discount, or a free month, or prices going up, etc. Companies that have budget might not care that they are getting a discount, but might care that they can pay monthly. Find out what they care about, and use that as your urgency. \
`Throwing discounts left and right with expiration dates DOES NOT WORK.`

**SOFU examples:**

### **Next Step**

_This is how an AE organizes what they need to do next in a deal._ \
\
Add the Date first, then what needs to be done on that date. And add more dates and things to be done in the future as well. \
For example:

14/1 - Setup trial and send follow-up email with X,Y,Z selling points that they liked + pricing\
16/1 - Follow-up to ask if they received email/pricing and if they had any feedback\
18/1 - Reach out to schedule a team demo to get other stakeholders bought in.\
19/1 - Fup with all stakeholders highlighting points they were interested in/liked\
20/1 - Get confirmation that trial went well and they are moving forward\
22/1 - Send order form to get procurement involved\
24/1 - Get signature and intro to CS

You can add each past Next Step to the bottom of the field so you can have a clear view of what you have done and where you are with the deal.

#### Next steps is an AEs North Star ⭐

It should guide you to hit quota. You are responsible for setting yourself up for success.

> \-Alex Ivos (Next Steps Connoisseur)

Your manager should be able to go into the Next Steps of your deals and see exactly what needs to be done to get the deal to closed won. This way we can work async and managers can help AEs move the deal along.
