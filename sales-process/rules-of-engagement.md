# Rules of Engagement

| Input            | Source of Truth | Owner         |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Sales forms      | Hubspot         | Account Owner |
| Intercom tickets | Hubspot         | Account Owner |
| Trialers         | Hubspot         | Account Owner |

### Source of Truth

Hubspot is the source of truth and supersedes any assignment in any other tool. See below for examples.&#x20;

| Tool     | Tool Owner | Hubspot Owner | Final Owner |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Intercom | Mark       | Alex          | Alex        |
| Hubspot  | Mark       | Alex          | Alex        |
| Trialers | Mark       | Alex          | Alex        |

### Edge cases

* I get assigned a new sales form but the account owner in Hubspot is someone else. I should then assign the sales form to the account owner.&#x20;
* I get assigned a new Intercom ticket but the account owner in Hubspot is someone else. I should then assign the intercom ticket to the account owner.&#x20;

### Best practices

* Always notify the new assignee in Slack.&#x20;
* Reach out to Adrien when in doubt.&#x20;
