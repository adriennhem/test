### Steps to complete when a prospect has signed our order form.

* Make sure the correct GitBook org is associated with the deal **AND** the org ID is filled in the deal information field, very important for tracking
* Fill out all the rest of the mandatory fields in the deal on HubSpot (Hubspot will tell you if you miss any)
* Make sure the primary contacts are associated with the deal
* If the signed order form or PO isn't already attached via PandaDoc integration, attach it
* Check [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16SGfDdRSwSkDDGznS6EdWn\_0FqEwtajPchDdRotPzHg/edit?usp=sharing) to see who's up for CSM assignment, unless there are extenuating circumstances that would make one CSM the choice (use case, previous relationship, time zones)
* Fill out the [AE <> CS Handoff notes](https://app.hubspot.com/playbooks/8443689/compose/658746) Playbook found on the bottom of right-hand sidebar in the deal record, see below Loom for details but it's pretty straightforward
