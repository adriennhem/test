# Order Forms

## Create an order form

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/01df9d240f184194851ded553a7bced3" %}

1. Visit a deal in Hubspot.
2. You will find the Pandadoc widget on the right sidebar.
3. Click on **Create Document.**
4. Select the correct template.
5. Make sure you have the correct recipients (yourself and the signer from prospect company).
6. Click **Start Editing**. You will be redirected to Pandadoc.
7. Once in PandaDoc, click the Send button and the form will first send to you and once you're done it will then send to the signer at the company. **Do not edit while in the PandaDoc UI because that is editing the layout**, the fields are already set up properly and you can fill them in once it gets to your email.
8. Customise the email before sending (optional)

## Important notes

* The effective date fields should be the day the contract starts (what will become the customers renewal date) and the second date should be one day before that in the next calendar year. For example, if I have a client starting Nov 1, 2022 - then I would put the effective date field as 1/11/2022 - 31/10/2023. The reason for this is that the next contract will start upon that renewal date.
* Always put the full prices in the order form. If you have agreed to some sort of discounting, put that in the special terms section of the order form and it will be reflected in stripe and on the invoice. The reason is we want the client to legally agree to the full price so when the discount runs out we switch their price to the full rate.
* Never modify the order form without talking to Dave first.
* Send for approval once you are done editing the doc.
