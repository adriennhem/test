# Registering as a vendor

## What is it?

Registration is used as a threshold requirement to separate vendors who are eligible suppliers and those who are not. Vendor registration involves collecting key information from outside suppliers of goods and services and entering that information into a system.

When we complete a vendor application for an organization, we are making them aware of our company, and of the products and services we can provide. This means that they are aware that we provide that product, and they may notify our company when they need to buy that particular product or service.
