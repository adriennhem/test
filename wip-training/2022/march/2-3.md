## Key takeaways

Setting next steps

* Getting a commit from them to give us feedback. Commitment to replying to us.\

* Setting next step in the calendar.

You ask them about next step. What is it? Meeting with team. When is that meeting? It’s on X day, what time? X time.

Great, would you be against having a 15-min sync an hour after that?&#x20;

* Creating a sense of team/Champion. And you’re doing as a team.
* Show them that we are a valuable resource
