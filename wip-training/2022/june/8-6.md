The timeline for this project should be:

* 6/8: Have the following completed by our next meeting:&#x20;
* Understand the budget for this project (what the budget would be to put on CC and what budget would be to go through the procurement process)&#x20;
*
  * If we do need to go through procurement, what does that process look like?
* Get an accurate number of users needed across Service Towers (both readers and editors)
* Send over the security risk assessment questionnaire
* 6/10: Zach to present pricing for FNF (based on user discussion on 6/8)
* 6/13: Justin to initiate procurement process (if necessary)
* 6/20: Zach to complete the security risk assessment questionnaire
* 7/1: Complete Security Risk Assessment and Procurement Process (if necessary)&#x20;
* 7/11: Agreement finalized, Order Form Signed, and intro to Customer Success team\

* 7/11-7/29: Onboarding and rollout with Customer Success Team

Does this two-month timeline look realistic to you? Do you predict any surprise steps that I haven't considered?
