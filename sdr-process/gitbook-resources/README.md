## Where can I ask questions about GitBook?

#### Support Bucket

If you have a question about a how something works in GitBook, or if GitBook has a certain feature, you should use the [Support Bucket in GitHub](https://github.com/GitbookIO/support-bucket/discussions). Check out the [onboarding guide here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MMfZKNoA5f8Z7rvVL1K/processes/support-bucket/support-bucket-onboarding).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before you start a new discussion in Support Bucket, remember to search and see if that question has already been asked!

#### Slack

You should always try and ask your questions in Support Bucket first. Support Bucket is the support team's preferred way of working, and Slack is not a good repository for information. By asking questions in Support Bucket, you are helping to build a repository of information that will be useful for everyone in the team.&#x20;

But if you need an answer really quickly, or you think someone in the team already knows, you can try these channels:

* `#customer-experience` - our team channel. Maybe someone in CX already knows
* `#support-engineering` - to speak with the Support and Engineering teams. Please avoid asking here unless you need a really quick response
