# Sales Strategy - S2/2021

{% hint style="info" %}
This strategy is ambitious but so are our goals. It is okay if we don't have all the answers now. What is important at this stage is to go in the right direction
{% endhint %}

## Mission Statement

> Guide and align users through the buying journey with a PLG approach.

* We do product-led Sales at GitBook.&#x20;
* We want to have a Land and Expand motion (L\&E).&#x20;
* We have both a bottom-up and top-down approach.&#x20;
  * It is bottom-up because we have hand-raisers that for whatever reasons are not able to purchase the product online after evaluating the product and they need a Salesperson to help. We will call those users "Hand-raisers". &#x20;
  * It is also top-down because we reach out to users who share similar characteristics and behaviors with our paid customers.

## Goals

{% hint style="info" %}
We are successful if we achieve the target: "Hit the target the right way" and "Build the sales team". We have the best series A team in tech if we achieve all goals.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Hit $15,200 MRR run rate by 31st December 2021.&#x20;
  * Maintain a pipeline worth $40,000 MRR for January 2022.&#x20;
  * Puts us in a good position to close $2.2M ARR by Sales in 2022.&#x20;
  * &#x20;You can see the revenue split [here](sales-strategy-s2-2021.md#mission-statement).&#x20;
* Hit the target the right way.&#x20;
  * Junior AEs focus on Sales-assisted deals.
  * &#x20;See the ideal responsibilities map below for LAEs. &#x20;
  * See the ideal responsibilities map below for EAEs.
* Build a sales team of at least 7 members.
  * By December 2021 we have the team that can help us hit $10M ARR.
  * 2022 focuses on building the team leadership and staff for 2023.&#x20;
  * Create an environment that fosters discipline and productivity.

## Current Responsibilities' Map

| Activities                   | Existing Customers | New Business |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Sales forms                  | AE                 | AE           |
| Hand-raisers                 | AE                 | AE           |
| PQLs                         | N/A                | N/A          |
| Sales-assisted               | AE                 | AE           |
| Renewals without negotiation | Customer Success   | N/A          |
| Renewals with negotiation    | AE                 | N/A          |
| Account Management           | N/A                | N/A          |

### Weaknesses of this approach&#x20;

* Today we achieve revenue targets with sales but **we do it the wrong way**. Most of their time is spent on low ACV deals that are part of the Sales-assisted segment. This is not a problem now because of the limited value provided by the product as well as limited resources (we only have one ramped-up salesperson). This is revenue that would be lost otherwise.
* **We are missing out on PQLs** as those users share similar characteristics with our paid users but no one talks to them.&#x20;
* **We are missing out on account management**. We are getting X new paying accounts every month. And X accounts have more than X employees.&#x20;
* Reps have to handle more deals than feasible. &#x20;

### Why we are doing it

* We focus on exceeding targets every month to show a positive trend with the sales motion.&#x20;
* Help the company achieves its high-level revenue goal.&#x20;
* We have not reached the minimum viable team size yet. We are submerged by the inputs we get every month.&#x20;

## Ideal Responsibilities' Map

| Activities                   | Existing Customers | New Business |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Sales forms                  | Expansion AE       | Land AE      |
| Hand-raisers                 | EAE                | LAE          |
| PQLs                         | EAE                | LAE          |
| Sales-assisted               | Customer Success   | Junior Sales |
| Renewals with negotiation    | EAE                | N/A          |
| Renewals without negotiation | Customer Success   | N/A          |
| Account Management           | EAE                | N/A          |

### Strength of the approach

* Start the expand motion and master the land motion. 50% conversion rate on new businesses.&#x20;
* LAEs focus on deals worth $300+ MRR. The MRR focus increases as the product evolves.
* No impact on the revenue as sales-assisted deals are handled by Junior AEs. No commission is paid so we don't care whether the deal could have been self-served or not.
* We effectively cover the different activities, decrease context switching, increase productivity.&#x20;
* We can change the "nuance" of LAE and EAE as they will both have transferable skills.&#x20;

### What do we need to fully transition?

* GBX to be released and assess early impact in order to adjust the hiring roadmap.&#x20;
* Ship enterprise features. One tier A per quarter. Examples below:&#x20;
  * &#x20;SCIM.
  * Advanced security features.
  * SOC2.
  * Integrations for VA.&#x20;
* A Junior Sales with a focus on closing sales-assisted deals.&#x20;

### Reality Check

#### Break down for AE with Land focus

* A linear approach based on the input as we know that the model already works.&#x20;
* **50% win rate** on deals with ARPA of $569.&#x20;
* We have** PQLs** that we need to unlock. We only need 2 deals at $800 MRR per month per rep. This is not a stretch. &#x20;

![We had fewer deals from existing customers in 2021](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-06-14 at 15.16.55.png>)

### Break down for AE with Expand focus

* 400 paid accounts with 200+ employees.&#x20;
* We have a healthy number of new paying customers every month.&#x20;
* GBX will empower the "expand" motion.&#x20;
* We have hand-raisers that are customers.&#x20;
* It's a controlled experimentation as we have enough volume from other activities to shift focus if needed.&#x20;

#### Reality check for Junior AE

* $20,000 MRR generated over 6 months on deals worth less or equal to $240 MRR. &#x20;
* 50% conversion rate on those deals
* We can extrapolate a yearly target of $20,000 MRR or $1,700 MRR per month.&#x20;
* ROI of 3.5X. Looking to hire someone with a total salary of $55,000.&#x20;
* Removes small deals from AEs.&#x20;

### Forecast

* This forecast puts us on a good trajectory for next year.&#x20;
* We would end up with a run rate of $15,200 MRR per month for 2022 (Yearly $182,400 MRR).
