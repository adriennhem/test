# Requesting holidays

You can request PTOs to your direct manager in Slack or email. It is always preferable to discuss your PTOs in your 1:1 with your direct manager. Make sure to copy [Simmoni De Weck](https://app.gitbook-alpha.com/u/yYgsAaYvI3a8GQAteUdPcAuPUu52 "mention")in the email.&#x20;

## Before you go on holidays

* Set an OOO email.&#x20;
* Update the OOO calendar.&#x20;
* Find someone to cover your work while you are OOO.&#x20;
